Specification's

Comments from business unit: "Recently I was updating the types of business one our agents was allowed to quote when I realized that I didn't know
how often each type of insurance coverage was quoted.  This information could be learned through reports, but it would be very convenient to be able
to identify which types of insurance were most popular and which ones were not being quoted often when updating an agents authority.  Could we get 
something added to the screen?"

Comments from technical specifications team: "The UX team has reviewed the functionality request and believes it would be most useful for users if
their requested data appeared on all screens, directly below the existing tabs "Search" and "View All Lines Of Business".  The existing quote data
is available in "in-memory-data.service.ts", but will need to be summed and displayed for it to be useful.  Knowing the two most popular lines of 
business all the time would be best.  In addition, displaying how many quotes a given line of business has on the details page would be useful for 
the user."

Insurance Definitions:

Agent - A person or business who sells insurance to an insured, on behalf of a carrier.  They are similar to a "retail store" in the insurance transaction.

Coverage - A specific type of protection an insurance policy provides.  For example, if someone had "Building" coverage on their commercial property policy
they would be protected in the event that a fire broke out in their covered building.  Coverage and line of business are sometimes used interchangeably.  

Insurance Carrier - A business that underwrites the risks and pays out claims for an insurance policy.  They are the manufacturer in the insurance transaction.

Insured - Person or business buying insurance coverage.  They are the customer in the insurance transaction.

Line of Business - This is a collection of related insurance coverages, that represent the specific needs of an insured.  For example, the line of business 
"Commercial Property" includes coverages such as "Building", "Business Income", and "Signs".
